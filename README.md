# Project RHPA - Animal Safety AI

## 🚀 Overview
Project RHPA (Road Hazard Prevention for Animals) is an AI-powered system designed to detect animals in high-risk zones using deep learning models. This project compares **DenseNet121** and **EfficientNetB3** models for animal safety predictions.

## ✨ Features
- **Deep Learning Analysis:** Uses **DenseNet121** and **EfficientNetB3** for animal detection.
- **Image Prediction:** Upload an image to classify and predict high-risk animal presence.
- **Video Analysis:* * Upload a video for processing and detection of animals in road hazard zones.
- **Flask Web Interface:** A simple web-based UI built with Flask and HTML for user interaction.

```

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required packages:
```sh
pip install flask torch torchvision numpy pandas
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Flask App
```sh
python app.py
```
The server will start, and you can access the web app at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## 🎯 How It Works
1. **Upload an Image:** The system processes the image using **DenseNet121** and **EfficientNetB3** and returns predictions.
2. **Upload a Video:** The AI analyzes the video and highlights potential high-risk animals detected in road hazard areas.
3. **View Results:** The processed image/video is displayed with prediction details.

## 🏆 Model Comparisons
| Model            | Accuracy | Processing Speed |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| DenseNet121     | High     | Moderate      |
| EfficientNetB3  | Very High | Fast         |

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Improve detection accuracy with **YOLOv5**.
- Implement real-time streaming support.
- Deploy as a cloud-based API service.
